# VIPS-Airpixel-Stream

Welcome to the VIPS-Airpixel-Stream repository! This repository contains documentation, code examples, and tools for working with the flexible binary data stream from VIPS and Airpixel products. Whether you're integrating these products into your projects or simply exploring their capabilities, this repository hopefully provides the resources you need.

## Repository Contents

1. Documentation
    - [docs/Serial_Stream_Specification.docx](<docs/VIPS+Airpixel output end user documentation.docx>):
      - A comprehensive document detailing the serial stream specification, including data structure, field descriptions, and usage guidelines.
    - [docs/ReadMe](docs/README.md): A web friendly markdown file containing the same information in the document, stripped back to the essentials for parsing the stream.

2. Code Examples
    - Examples in multiple programming languages to help you parse and work with the serial data stream:
        - [C#](<examples/C-Sharp/VIPS Packets.cs>)
        - [Python](examples/Python/FlexibleBinaryStreamUtils.py)
        - [Rust](examples/Rust/src/lib.rs)
    - Each example demonstrates how to parse the stream and handle its fields based on the specification. If you have any questions, or need any help with another language, please get in touch.

3. Simulator
   - [Simulator](<simulator>): A prebuilt application that simulates the VIPS and Airpixel serial streams for testing and development purposes.

If any part of the documentation is unclear, or you need further information, please don't hesitate to get in contact via <support@racelogic.co.uk>.
